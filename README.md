Tkinter
=======
A small python/Tkinter application assigned as groupwork for the module Developing Quality Software during my first year. 
This application was developed for a university open day, allowing students to enter their details to receive more information from the 
School of Computer Science. The application also offered a questionnaire that helped students determine their most suitable
course offered by the school, as well as a small quiz to test their current knowledge.
